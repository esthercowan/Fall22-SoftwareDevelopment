# Fall22-SoftwareDevelopment

This is a project written for CS 3240 (Advanced Software Development Techniques) at UVA. The project is intended to be a course-finding and schedule-building application for students at UVA. It was written using the Django 4 framework, uses the Bootstrap 5 library for UI/UX features, and was hosted on Heroku. 

My contributions to this project included:
  * Implementing the Google sign-in feature 
  * Creating the Department and Subject models to host and organize all the different classes offered
  * Implementing the logic behind adding and removing courses to/from a user's schedule
  * Developing a rating feature as a way for students to leave a numerical rating for the courses they've taken
  * Aligning users' schedules with their usernames so students can view each other's schedules
  * Designing the user interface for the course department and courses pages
